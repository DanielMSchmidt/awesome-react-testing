# How to Contribute

## SIMPLE!
**Just do your update in the readme!**

If you can, please run `yarn update:toc` to update the table of contents at the top of the file.  If you cannot (using web only contributions), we'll take care of that for you.

Feel free to help make this a wonderful awesome repo!

### Caveats
The following rules are in place to make everyone's lives easy!

1. No blatant self-promotion
2. Do not manually update the table of contents
3. We will add you to the all-contributors list at the bottom once your PR is accepted.
